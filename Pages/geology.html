 <h1> about geology</h1>
 <p  id="geology">Geology (from the Ancient Greek γῆ, gē ("earth") and -λoγία, -logia, ("study of", "discourse")) is a branch of Earth science concerned with the solid Earth, 
     the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. 
     Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. 
     Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences, including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated Earth system science and planetary science.
    </p>

  <p id="explain"> Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped that structure. 
      It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given location, 
      and also to describe the histories of those rocks. By combining these tools, 
      geologists are able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, 
      and also to demonstrate the age of the Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, 
      the evolutionary history of life, and the Earth's past climates.</p>
