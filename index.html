    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h3>Hi. Today Iam going to talk about geology</h3>

    <p id="paragraph"> The materials found throughout this section of the website are meant to be good starting places for begin exploring the broad field of geology. Several of these pages provide new learners to geology a broad introduction to some of the field’s most important concepts,
         which will be important later for better understanding the Evolution and Climate Change pages!</p>

         <p id="excerpt"> Geology, or Earth Science or the Geosciences, is the study of the Earth, which includes its interior and exterior processes, rocks, minerals, fossils, and all the surface processes that have shaped the landscape around us and continue to shape our lives today. These processes take place over different time scales, from hundreds of millions of years to hundreds of thousands of years, 
             a difficult concept to grasp as humans have only been present for a short amount of time in the wide breadth of Earth’s history. </p>
